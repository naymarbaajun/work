<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>The general objective of a task allocation system is to assign tasks <br> individuals or groups in an efficient and effective manner. This can involve assigning tasks to team members based on their skills, availability, and workload, or it can involve assigning tasks to machines or other resources. The goal is usually to optimize the use of resources, reduce workload imbalances, and improve overall productivity and efficiency. Task allocation systems can be used in a variety of contexts, including businesses, schools, hospitals, industry and other organization.</p>
